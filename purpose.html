            <h2>Purpose of the Robot Monkey</h2>
            <p>At BYU-I, the Robot Monkey has been introduced to enhance campus safety and provide additional support to our students. 
                Designed with advanced sensors and cameras, it patrols the campus 24/7, monitoring for suspicious activities and potential hazards. 
                Beyond security, it assists students by offering directions, answering questions, and providing quick first aid, 
                ensuring a safer and more convenient campus life.</p>
