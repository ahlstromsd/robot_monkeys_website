            <p>There will be a model of robot monkey that will primarily be focused on assistance for students. It will
                have a first
                aid kit stored in it and will be able to recognize students. These models will have self-defense
                capabilities. The
                second model will be for security and will have a taser installed to subdue perpetrators.</p>
